 * connectivity at that time). Note that this property must be set before creating your first Firebase
 * reference and only needs to be called once per application.
 *
 * If your app uses Firebase Authentication, the client will automatically persist the user's authentication
 * token across restarts, even without persistence enabled. But if the auth token expired while offline and
 * you've enabled persistence, the client will pause write operations until you successfully re-authenticate
 * (or explicitly unauthenticate) to prevent your writes from being sent unauthenticated and failing due to
 * security rules.
